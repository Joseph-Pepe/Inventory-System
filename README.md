# Inventory-System
Inventory System developed by implementing a compact data structure using an array in the the Java programming language. Its a Generic Type container built from scratch that can hold objects.

A List Data Structure using an array implementation.

Note: Requires a comprehensive understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.




***[Comparable.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/Comparable.java)***
---
> Comparable interface used to compare objects to sort by the objects properties.

***[Copyable.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/Copyable.java)***
---
> Copyable interface used to duplicate the object and retain its properties.

***[Inventory.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/Inventory.java)***
---
> A generic container used to store a collection of objects of any type.

***[ListException.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/ListException.java)***
---
> An exception used in the Inventory class to indicate erroneous behavior by displaying a run-time error message.

***[ListInterface.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/ListInterface.java)***
---
> Interface used by the Inventory class to enforce the collection to act as a List data structure.

***[ReadBinaryFile.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/ReadBinaryFile.java)***
---
> Reads the contents of a binary file and converts it to text format to be display on the command line. 

***[ReadInventoryFile.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/ReadInventoryFile.java)***
---
> Reads the contents of a text file that displays the data of each object in the collection saved.

***[SaveInventoryItems.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/SaveInventoryItems.java)***
---
> Saves all the objects data from inside the collection to a text file.

***[SerializeObjects.java](https://github.com/Joseph-Pepe/Inventory-System/blob/master/SerializeObjects.java)***
---
> Performs serialization and de-serialization on the Videogame objects in the collection.
